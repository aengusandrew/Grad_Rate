Data Cleanup is being done in this notebook so it's easier to see results immediately. The Markdown portion of this isn't very important only the Notebook.

```{r}
Omitted_School = na.omit(School_Data)
Omitted_School
```

With all NAs omitted there are only 2 schools that report all their data, so some rows will need to be removed.


```{r}
